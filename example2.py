#Problem Statement – An automobile company manufactures both a two wheeler (TW) and a four wheeler (FW). A company manager wants to make the production of both types of vehicle according to the given data below:

#1st data, Total number of vehicle (two-wheeler + four-wheeler)=v
#2nd data, Total number of wheels = W
#The task is to find how many two-wheelers as well as four-wheelers need to manufacture as per the given data.
#Example :

#Input :
#200  -> Value of V
#540   -> Value of W

#Output :
#TW =130 FW=70

#Explanation:
#130+70 = 200 vehicles
#(70*4)+(130*2)= 540 wheels

#Constraints :

#2<=W
#W%2=0
#V<W
#Print “INVALID INPUT” , if inputs did not meet the constraints.

v=200
w=540

if (w & 1) == 1 or w<2 or w<=v :
    print('invalid input')
else: 
    x=((4*v)- w)//2
    print('TW={0} FW={1}'.format(x,v-x))
